# TornAPIDesktop
Some testing has been done to try and make sure application runs smoothly. If there are any issues or requests for features within the API rules i will try to assist. 
# Usage
This app at the start will need your api key. You can go to the settings and enter this then click save. In order for the save function to work you need to put the executable into a file you can read from and write to.

To use this app place items.json, Newtonsoft.Json.dll, Newtonsoft.Json.xml, Settings.json and TornMainForm.exe into a folder you have read and write privileges or download the AllAppRequiredFilesTorn folder. 

This is a Desktop application so you don't need to share your api key with anyone else.

# Purpose
  
This is a desktop application that uses your Torn API key to fetch information about your account and updates it periodically to keep you up to date on typical information such as; cooldowns, energy timers, bank money, status and other in game features.

An item search page is featured so you see the effect, market price, buy price, sale price, description and quantity of the item in circulation.
